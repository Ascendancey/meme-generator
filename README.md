MERN stack is used for this application. After cloning the repository, you need to run `npm install` in the backend folder and in the frontend folder.
The application is connected to the MongoDB Atlas and the credentials are saved inside the `.env` file in the backend folder (no further configuration required).

To launch the application, you need to run two processes and therefore open two terminals:

Terminal 1:
`cd backend`
`npm start`

Terminal 2:
`cd frontend`
`npm start`

This will open the web app page in your default browser.

Have fun testing the memes!
